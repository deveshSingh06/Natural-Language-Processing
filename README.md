Here, I have discussed some techniques of converting a text, which could be a word or a sentence, to a d-dimensional vector.

## Why convert text to a vector?
- Converting a text to a vector helps us use the linear algebra.
- Using linear algebra we can find out the distances between different vectors corresponding to different texts.
- This could help us classify various groups of texts such as positive and negative texts.


**Note:**- A text, which could be a word or a sentence, is known as a document in NLP.
- A collection of such documents is known as document corpus.
